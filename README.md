# Unit-Convertor-And-Dimension-Validator-With-Java
A lightweight Java project that provides unit conversion (e.g., m → km, kg → g, hr → sec) as well as dimension validation (e.g., checking whether m/s and km/hr represent the same physical dimension). The goal is to offer a reusable and extendable calculation engine for scientific, engineering, and backend applications.
